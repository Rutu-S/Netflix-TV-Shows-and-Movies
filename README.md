# Netflix-TV-Shows-and-Movies Dashboard

Netflix TV Shows and Movies Dashboard provides a compact, high-level view of Netflix’s entire catalog—showing total statistics (≈ 8.8 K titles, 19 rating categories, 517 genres across 749 countries)—alongside breakdowns of genre popularity, rating distribution, and content type. It also highlights the leading producer countries (with the U.S., India, UK, etc.), the share of movies vs. TV shows, and how releases have spiked particularly in recent years.


The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
• 📂 Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
• 📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

Data on around 8.8K titles spanning 749 countries—and visualizes key attributes like ratings (e.g. TV‑MA, TV‑14), genres, content type (movies vs TV shows), and release year trends. It highlights dominant countries of origin (e.g. United States, India), genre frequencies (Documentaries, Stand‑Up Comedy, International Dramas), and shows a strong surge in releases from ~2014–2021.

Business Problem:- How can Netflix better understand and optimize its global content strategy?
By analyzing the composition and performance of its 8.8K-title content catalog across ratings, genres, content types, countries, and release years, decision-makers can:
Identify content production and rating trends,
Reveal genre and country-level gaps or opportunities, and
Strategically allocate investments toward the right type of content (e.g., mature vs. kids, movies vs. series) in high‑growth regions. 
This insight ultimately helps the platform align content acquisitions and productions with audience demand and revenue objectives.



Goal of the Dashboard:-
To provide a clear, interactive view into Netflix’s global content library—spanning ~8,800 titles—by visualizing trends in content type (movies vs TV shows), genres, ratings, release years, and country of origin. By uncovering patterns in regional production, genre distribution, and rating demographics, the dashboard empowers data-driven decisions around content strategy, recommendation personalization, and investment allocation to optimize viewer engagement and global growth.
